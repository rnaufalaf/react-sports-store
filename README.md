# react-sports-store
A simple transaction recording app to assign sports item to User. Made with React and utilizing React Router DOM for routing the pages, and Tailwind CSS on the client-side, and Node.js with Express.js, PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM on the server-side. This mini project also utilizes Axios for bridging the client-side and the server-side of the application.
